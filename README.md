This repo contains the code used to process, analyze and report on the Summer of 2019's work for Why Forests Matter on behalf of a student intern within the Tague Lab at UCSB's Bren School of Environmental Science and Management.

The goal of the work was to model how a changing climate might affect carbon dynamics within coastal redwood forests.
